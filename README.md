### Hey! 👋

I'm Caroline, a current undergraduate at Ohio State majoring in Marketing with minors in Business Analytics and Studio Art - check out my resume [here]('URL'). I currently work at Abbott Laboratories, within their internal marketing agency WhiteSpace, as an Associate Marketing Analyst. Get in touch at caroline.eggett@gmail.com - I'm always open to chat and create new connections!

- 🔭 My current software involvements:
    - Programming analytical, Python-based machine learning for my Predictive Analytics class.  You can check out what we're working on on GitHub at [github.com/caroline-eggett/BUSOBA3332]('https://github.com/caroline-eggett/BUSOBA3332'). This is part of my business analytics minor coursework. 
    - Statistical analytical, R-based machine learning for my Predictive Analytics class.  You can check out what we're working on GitHub at [github.com/'more to come']('URL'). This is part of my business analytics minor coursework. 
- ⚡ What I like to do outside of work:
    - Read ([books I have read]('https://www.goodreads.com/caroline_eggett'))
    - Try different coffee roasts (my coffee roast so far is from a St. Croix, US Virgin Islands coffee shop)
    - Run (I've run two half marathons--about to run my third in Chicago, IL)

I'm just starting this out, so there's not much to see YET! Get in touch with me at caroline.eggett@gmail.com!
